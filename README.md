# Crowdfunding_ETL

## This project used SQL to extract information regarding crowdfunded projects to ultimately contact the owners and contributors to various live projects to inform them of the amount of money needed to meet their pledged amounts. Ideally, the campaign owners can use the information to contact interested parties to fulfill the gap, and can notify those who have already donated to see if they can donate more to help address the gap, or spread awareness through various means since they agreed with the campaign enough to donate to it
